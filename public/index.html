      <p> I have my content written up in a document, so I just placed rough texts into the site to simulate what it would be like.</p>
      <div class="container text-center">
            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <hr class="small">
            <p>This website will take you through Canada’s dark past of racial prejudice. We will begin with after Canada had been established, thus the acts we can judge upon would be those of Canadian merit, not French or British.</p>

            <p>The journey will begin with the discrimination against the citizens of the First Nations. More so, focusing on the Indian Act which is a piece of legislation created by the Canadian government.</p>

            <p>We will then go further to discuss another piece of legislation created by the government to exclude Chinese Canadians via the Chinese Immigration Act, also known as the Exclusion Act.</p>

            <p>Afterwards we will discuss racism during War times and the internment camps made for Japanese Canadians.</p>

            <p>The common theme of the acts of racism above is that they were engaged with government legislation. But in reality, a lot of racism is performed outside of the government for example with racism against Black Canadians in Nova scotia.</p>

            <p>Alongside, the racism against Muslim and Sikh’s after the 9/11 attacks in America. Canadians were also affected by this discrimination.</p>

            <p>As you can see there has been lots of acts of racism in Canada’s history, but why should we care now since they were all in the past? We can tie these events to those in the present and make them meaningful. As we will see some of these events still effect the lives of Canadians today.
            Furthermore, we should be able to link these racist events together on a theoretical level, were they all the same type of racism? Do they all have a certain premise? Why did we choose these specific examples?
            Lastly, this would be meaningless if we did not also approach the side of what Canada has done as a country in the attempt to reconcile, or respond to these hate crimes. As Canadians, we pride ourselves as loving and multicultural, and this can be shown by responses that Canadian made after these hate crimes.
            Now, let’s get into the specifics and follow through these terrible events that have occurred in Canada’s past.</p>

    <!-- First Nations Racism -->
    <section id="first_nations" class="main_section">
      <div class="container text-center">
            <h2>Racism Against First Nations in Canada</h2>
            <hr class="small">
            <div class="pdf-viewer"></div>
            <p>First, we are starting off with what could be one of the most discriminatory pieces of legislation ever placed within the Canadian Government. This being The Indian Act, which was first introduced in 1867 (Reference 1).</p>

            <p>This act has been pushed and pulled for change among the years due to the discrimination to the First Nations people within the piece of legislation itself. Although there are some parts of this act that give First Nations people certain rights and status. Just by the name it is overtly racist, claiming that the indigenous people of Canada are Indian, which is not true.</p>

            <p>Throughout the years there has been many attempts to amend the act, one being in 1969, which called for the abolishment of the Indian Act via the White Paper (Reference 2). This was overwhelmingly rejected by the First Nations community as it stripped them of certain rights and freedoms. With all the negative backlash, this paper was withdrawn in 1971.</p>

            <p>One disgusting law from the Indian act which stayed until 1951 was the following:</p>

            <p><i>"Every Indian or other person who engages in or assists in celebrating the Indian festival known as the "Potlach" or in the Indian dance known as the "Tamanawas" is guilty of a misdemeanor, and shall be liable to imprisonment ... and any Indian or other person who encourages ... an Indian or Indians to get up such a festival or dance, or to celebrate the same, ... is guilty of a like offence ...(58) (reference 3)"</i></p>

            <p>This is extremely discriminatory against First Nations people on the basis of one of their traditions. This type of oppression of culture by the Canadian government actually led to arrests across the West Coast of Canada. Even though this was in the past, from late 19th century into the mid 20th century.</p>

            <p>But again, to reiterate the Indian Act still exists in the Canadian Government today. There have been many alterations and adaptions that have come along the times, but still regressive ideas remain. (Add more recent stuff here, must research about Bill S-3)</p>

    <!-- Chinese Canadian Racism -->
    <section id="chinese" class="main_section">
      <div class="container text-center">
            <h2>Racism Against Chinese Canadians in Canada</h2>
            <hr class="small">
            <p>The Chinese Immigration Act of 1923 is another piece of Canadian legislation that shows the dark side of Canada past. On July 1st 1923 this act went into effect which banned Chinese immigrants from entering Canada unless they were a diplomat, student or under special circumstances.</p>

            <p>Coincidentally, this was the same day as Dominion Day so the creation of this act became Humiliation Day for Chinese-Canadians and they refused to take part in any type of celebration at this time. Furthermore, this act did not only affect those from China, but any ethnic Chinese even those under British nationality as well. As taken from this it is strictly seen as an oppression of Chinese Canadians within Canada. This act was finally repealed in 1947 following World War 2 and the United Nations Charter of Human Rights, which Canada was a signatory.</p>

            <p>Nonetheless, this act left a huge impact on Canada and its Chinese population as seen in the following image:</p>
            <img src="https://tc2.ca/sourcedocs/uploads/images/HD%20Sources%20(text%20thumbs)/Chinese%20Canadian%20History/Consequences%20of%20the%20Exclusion%20Act/Consequences-of-the-Chinese-Exclusion-Act%206.jpg"></img>
            <p>As you can see populations largely decreased while the act was in play, allowing no more Chinese immigrants to come to Canada. Not only did this affect those who wanted to immigrate to Canada, it largely affected those Chinese-Canadians who had family in China, who could not immigrate to Canada. Regardless of their citizenship, they were not allowed to return back to Canada which put a lot of emotional abuse on these families who were separated due to discrimination.</p>

    <!-- Japanese Canadian Racism -->

            <h2>Racism Against Japanese Canadians in Canada</h2>
            <hr class="small">
            <p>Now since we’ve gone through two pieces of legislation and a lot of reading, I’m going to provide a bunch of images and videos.</p>

            <!-- CAROUSEL -->
            <div class="japanese-carousel demo-carousel"></div>
            <p>For more images like this, and more detail on the images above, they were used from a <a href="http://nationalpost.com/news/canada/rare-views-of-japanese-canadian-internment-19-images-remembering-one-of-canadas-darkest-hours">National Post</a> article.</p>
            <p>Furthermore, here is a video from the Canadian Government apologizing for the war-time internment.</p>

            <p>As you can from these videos and images at the type of treatment to Japanese Canadians at this time was horrific, and just due to their race they were treated as such.</p>
            <p>This treatment still has repercussions on people today as you can see from this interview with Pat Adachi.</p>

            <hr class="small">
            <p>As one of the most discussed topics of discrimination in the 20th century. Many people focus on the facts that a lot of racism stems from the United States, due to them being a big player in civil rights. This overshadows a lot of Canada’s dark past, even though Trudeau released the multi-culturalism policy in 1971. The last segregated school in Canada was closed in Nova Scotia, which was in 1983. There was no law keeping the schools segregated, they were just segregated due to the fact of the social system in Nova Scotia.</p>
            <p>Not only is this discrimination affecting the social life of African-Canadians within Nova Scotia it also affects their education which should be given to all Canadian citizens equally.</p>
            <p>Furthermore, there are some racist qualities still lingering today as the United Nations report on racism in the Nova Scotian school system today. (global news article). Where there are still “unconscious bias” as proclaimed in the following <a target="_blank" href="https://globalnews.ca/news/3778740/un-report-on-racism-validates-african-nova-scotian-experience-senator/">Global News article.</a> This has become an ongoing united nations investigation in attempt to remove this racism from the school system.</p>
