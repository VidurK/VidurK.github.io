            <hr class="small">
            <p>This website will take you through Canada’s dark past of racial prejudice. We will begin with after Canada had been established. Thus the acts we can judge upon would be those of Canadian merit, not French or British.</p>
            <p>The journey will begin with the discrimination against the citizens of the First Nations. More so, focusing on the Indian Act which is a piece of legislation created by the Canadian government.</p>
            <p>We will then go further to discuss another piece of legislation created by the government to exclude Chinese Canadians via the Chinese Immigration Act, also known as the Exclusion Act.</p>
            <p>Afterwards, we will discuss racism during War times and the internment camps made for Japanese Canadians.</p>
            <p>The common theme of the acts of racism above is that they were engaged with government legislation. But in reality, a lot of racism is performed outside of the government for example with racism against Black Canadians in Nova Scotia.</p>
            <p>Alongside, the racism against Muslim and Sikh’s after the 9/11 attacks in America. Canadians were also affected by this discrimination.</p>
            <p>As you can see there has been lots of acts of racism in Canada’s history, but why should we care now since they were all in the past? We can tie these events to those in the present and make them meaningful. As we will see some of these occurrences still affect the lives of Canadians today.</p>
            <p>Furthermore, we should be able to link these racist events together on a theoretical level, were they all the same type of racism? Do they all have a particular premise? Why did we choose these specific examples?</p>
            <p>Lastly, this would be meaningless if we did not also approach the side of what Canada has done as a country in the attempt to reconcile or respond to these hate crimes. As Canadians, we pride ourselves on loving and multicultural, and this can be shown by responses that Canadian made after these hate crimes.</p>
            <p>Now, let’s get into the specifics and follow through these terrible events that have occurred in Canada’s past.</p>

            <h2 class="text-center">Racism Against First Nations in Canada</h2>
            <hr class="small">
            <p>First, we are starting off with what could be one of the most discriminatory pieces of legislation ever placed within the Canadian Government. Which is The Indian Act, first introduced in 1867.</p>
            <!-- Indian Act -->
            <div class="pdf-viewer"></div>
            <p>This act has been pushed and pulled for change among the years due to the discrimination to the First Nations people within the piece of legislation itself, although, some parts of this act give First Nations people certain rights and status. Just by the name, it is overtly racist, claiming that the indigenous people of Canada are Indian, which is not true.</p>
            <p>Throughout the years there have been many attempts to amend the act, one being in 1969, which called for the abolishment of the Indian Act via the White Paper (Reference 2). The White Paper was overwhelmingly rejected by the First Nations community as it stripped them of several rights and freedoms. With all the negative backlash, this paper was withdrawn in 1971. One disgusting law from the Indian act which stayed until 1951 was the following:</p>
            <p><i>Every Indian or other person who engages in or assists in celebrating the Indian festival known as the "Potlach" or in the Indian dance known as the "Tamanawas" is guilty of a misdemeanor, and shall be liable to imprisonment ... and any Indian or other person who encourages ... an Indian or Indians to get up such a festival or dance, or to celebrate the same, ... is guilty of a like offence ...(58)</i></p>
            <p>This is exceptionally discriminatory against First Nations people from one of their traditions. This type of oppression of culture by the Canadian government led to arrests across the West Coast of Canada, even though this was in the past, from late 19th century into the mid 20th century.</p>
            <p>But again, to reiterate the Indian Act still exists in the Canadian Government today. There have been many alterations and adaptions that have come along the times, but always conservative ideas remain.</p>
            <p> In more recent light we see that act to amend the <a href="https://openparliament.ca/bills/42-1/S-3/" target="_blank">Indian Act (elimination of sex-based inequities in registration)</a> is currently in circulation within parliament and is in the final stages of passing through. This act will hopefully aid those women in the First Nations to gain their citizenship and allow them to be citizens on their terms legally. Though this may not seem like a big deal fundamentally, it goes to show how things that might not be in the direct light of public attention could go under the radar for so long. Those who were affected by it were pressing for the change, but due to them being such a minority within Canadian Society it is challenging to build a loud enough voice to combat against the discrimination they face.</p>

    <!-- Chinese Canadian Racism -->

            <h2 class="text-center">Racism Against Chinese Canadians in Canada</h2>
            <hr class="small">
            <p>The Chinese Immigration Act of 1923 is another piece of Canadian legislation that shows the dark side of Canada past. On July 1st, 1923 this act went into effect which banned Chinese immigrants from entering Canada unless they were a diplomat, student or under exceptional circumstances.</p>
            <p>Coincidentally, this was the same day as Dominion Day, so the creation of this act became Humiliation Day for Chinese-Canadians, and they refused to take part in any celebration at this time. Furthermore, this action did not only affect those from China but any ethnic Chinese even those under British nationality as well. As taken from this it is strictly seen as an oppression of Chinese Canadians within Canada. This act got repealed in 1947 following World War 2 and the United Nations Charter of Human Rights, which Canada was a signatory.</p>
            <p>Nonetheless, this act left a huge impact on Canada and its Chinese population as seen in the following image:</p>
            <img style="display:block; margin: 0 auto;" src="https://tc2.ca/sourcedocs/uploads/images/HD%20Sources%20(text%20thumbs)/Chinese%20Canadian%20History/Consequences%20of%20the%20Exclusion%20Act/Consequences-of-the-Chinese-Exclusion-Act%206.jpg"></img>
            <p>As you can see populations largely decreased while the act was in play, allowing no more Chinese immigrants to come to Canada. Not only did this affect those who wanted to immigrate to Canada, it largely affected those Chinese-Canadians who had family in China, who could not immigrate to Canada. Regardless of their citizenship, they were not allowed to return to Canada which put a lot of emotional abuse on these families who were separated due to discrimination.</p>
            <p>This was a very dark moment in Canadian History as <a href="https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/national/text-of-harpers-speech/article20414337/)" target="_blank">Stephen Harper gave a formal apology</a> in 2006 for these heinous actions, you can read the full apology below:</p>
            <blockquote>
                <p class="c-article-body__text">Prime Minister Stephen Harper's speech Thursday on the Chinese head tax:</p>
                <p class="c-article-body__text">Mr. Speaker, I rise today to formally turn the page on an unfortunate period in Canada's past.</p>
                <p class="c-article-body__text">One during which a group of people - who only sought to build a better life - was repeatedly and deliberately singled out for unjust treatment.</p>
                <div id="" class="u-wrapper pb-feature pb-layout-item pb-f-commercial-dfp-ads">
                <div class="">&nbsp;</div>
                </div>
                <p class="c-article-body__text">I speak, of course, of the head tax that was imposed on Chinese immigrants to this country, as well as the other restrictive measures that followed.</p>
                <p class="c-article-body__text">The Canada we know today would not exist were it not for the efforts of the Chinese labourers who began to arrive in the mid-19th century.</p>
                <div id="" class="u-wrapper pb-feature pb-layout-item pb-f-article-asf-body-top">&nbsp;</div>
                <p class="c-article-body__text">Almost exclusively young men, these immigrants made the difficult decision to leave their families behind in order to pursue opportunities in a country halfway around the world they called "Gold Mountain."</p>
                <p class="c-article-body__text">Beginning in 1881, over 15,000 of these Chinese pioneers became involved in the most important nation-building enterprise in Canadian history - the construction of the Canadian Pacific Railway.</p>
                <p class="c-article-body__text">From the shores of the St. Lawrence, across the seemingly endless expanses of shield and prairie, climbing the majestic Rockies, and cutting through the rugged terrain of British Columbia.</p>
                <p class="c-article-body__text">This transcontinental link was the ribbon of steel that bound our fledgling country together. It was an engineering feat - one for which the back-breaking toil of Chinese labourers was largely responsible - that was instrumental to the settlement of the West and the subsequent development of the Canadian economy.</p>
                <p class="c-article-body__text">The conditions under which these men worked were at best harsh, and at times impossible: tragically, some one thousand Chinese labourers died building the CPR.</p>
                <div id="" class="u-wrapper pb-feature pb-layout-item pb-f-commercial-dfp-ads">
                <div class="">&nbsp;</div>
                </div>
                <p class="c-article-body__text">But in spite of it all, these Chinese immigrants persevered, and in doing so, helped to ensure the future of Canada.</p>
                <p class="c-article-body__text">But from the moment that the railway was completed, Canada turned its back on these men.</p>
                <p class="c-article-body__text">Beginning with the Chinese Immigration Act of 1885, a head tax of $50 was imposed on Chinese newcomers in an attempt to deter immigration.</p>
                <p class="c-article-body__text">Not content with the tax's effect, the government subsequently raised the amount to $100 in 1900, and then to $500 - the equivalent of two years' wages - in 1903.</p>
                <p class="c-article-body__text">This tax remained in place until 1923, when the government amended the Chinese Immigration Act and effectively banned most Chinese immigrants until 1947.</p>
                <p class="c-article-body__text">Similar legislation existed in the Dominion of Newfoundland, which also imposed a head tax between 1906 and 1949, when Newfoundland joined Confederation.</p>
                <div id="" class="u-wrapper pb-feature pb-layout-item pb-f-commercial-dfp-ads">
                <div class="">&nbsp;</div>
                </div>
                <p class="c-article-body__text">The government of Canada recognizes the stigma and exclusion experienced by the Chinese as a result.</p>
                <p class="c-article-body__text">We acknowledge the high cost of the head tax meant many family members were left behind in China, never to be reunited, or that families lived apart and, in some cases, in poverty, for many years.</p>
                <p class="c-article-body__text">We also recognize that our failure to truly acknowledge these historical injustices has led many in the community from seeing themselves as fully Canadian.</p>
                <p class="c-article-body__text">Therefore, Mr. Speaker, on behalf of all Canadians and the Government of Canada, we offer a full apology to Chinese Canadians for the head tax and express our deepest sorrow for the subsequent exclusion of Chinese immigrants.</p>
                <p class="c-article-body__text">Gar nar dai doe heem.</p>
                <p class="c-article-body__text">This apology is not about liability today: it is about reconciliation with those who endured such hardship, and the broader Chinese-Canadian community, one that continues to make such an invaluable contribution to our great country.</p>
                <p class="c-article-body__text">And while Canadian courts have ruled that the head tax, and immigration prohibition, were legally authorized, we fully accept the moral responsibility to acknowledge these shameful polices of our past.</p>
                <p class="c-article-body__text">For over six decades, these race-based financial measures, aimed solely at the Chinese, were implemented with deliberation by the Canadian state.</p>
                <p class="c-article-body__text">This was a grave injustice, and one we are morally obligated to acknowledge.</p>
                <p class="c-article-body__text">To give substantial meaning to today's apology, the Government of Canada will offer symbolic payments to living head tax payers and living spouses of deceased payers.</p>
                <p class="c-article-body__text">In addition, we will establish funds to help finance community projects aimed at acknowledging the impact of past wartime measures and immigration restrictions on ethno-cultural communities.</p>
                <p class="c-article-body__text">No country is perfect. Like all countries, Canada has made mistakes in its past, and we realize that.</p>
                <p class="c-article-body__text">Canadians, however, are a good and just people, acting when we've committed wrong.</p>
                <p class="c-article-body__text">And even though the head tax - a product of a profoundly different time - lies far in our past, we feel compelled to right this historic wrong for the simple reason that it is the decent thing to do, a characteristic to be found at the core of the Canadian soul.</p>
                <p class="c-article-body__text">Mr. Speaker, in closing, let me assure the House that this government will continually strive to ensure that similar unjust practices are never allowed to happen again.</p>
                <p class="c-article-body__text">We have the collective responsibility to build a country based firmly on the notion of equality of opportunity, regardless of one's race or ethnic origin.</p>
                <p class="c-article-body__text">Our deep sorrow over the racist actions of our past will nourish our unwavering commitment to build a better future for all Canadians.</p>
                <p class="c-article-body__text">Thank you.</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>To pull this away from the formal light, to see how this act affected those in Canadian Society at the time of the action being in progress. An individual who was the daughter of a family who had to pay the Head Tax discusses how her family was torn apart due to the head tax. <a href="https://www.straight.com/news/566171/vancouver-senior-describes-how-chinese-exclusion-act-ripped-her-family-apart" target="_blank">The story goes as follows</a>, Suichen Suen was born in 1931, when her father was on a brief visit back to Hong Kong. Under the federal government’s exclusion legislation from 1923 to 1947, Chinese Canadians were only allowed to stay out of the country for two years to visit family members, who were barred from joining them in Canada. This made it so that she was not able to see her father until the age of 16, where they could only sustain living with each other for a specified period. The family remained separated over plenty of years just due to the fact of them being of Chinese descent. This shows the significant impact the Head Tax had on families across the nation and how racism played a prominent role in Canada’s past.</p>

            <hr class="small">
            <p>As one of the most discussed topics of discrimination in the 20th century. Many people focus on the facts that a lot of racism stems from the United States, due to them being a big player in civil rights. This overshadows a lot of Canada’s dark past, even though Trudeau released the multi-culturalism policy in 1971. The last segregated school in Canada was closed in Nova Scotia, which was in 1983. There was no law keeping the schools segregated. Thus they remained isolated due to the fact of the social system in Nova Scotia.</p>
            <p>Not only is this discrimination affecting the social life of African-Canadians within Nova Scotia it also affects their education which should be given to all Canadian citizens equally. Furthermore, there are some racist qualities still lingering today as the United Nations report on racism in the Nova Scotian school system today. (global news article). Where there are still “unconscious bias” as proclaimed in the following <a href="https://globalnews.ca/news/3778740/un-report-on-racism-validates-african-nova-scotian-experience-senator/" target="_blank">Global News article</a>. This has become an ongoing united nations investigation in an attempt to remove this racism from the school system.</p>
            <p>In this following document, we can see to the extent of current racial prejudice happening in Nova Scotia to the anti-black racism occurring there at the moment. This extensive document which was a report collected and sent to the United Nations show that there is a current struggle for Black Canadians, and there is not much of a media outlet surrounding it.</p>

            <h2 class="text-center">Racism Against Muslim and Sikh Canadians in Canada</h2>
            <hr class="small">
            <p>To bring more attention to racism within today’s Canadian society, it’s best to talk about racism against those of Sikh and Muslim heritage. The origin of this type of racism stems from the terrorist attacks on America involving the World Trade Center. After this catastrophic incident occurred, the blame was put on those who fit the profile of the terrorist, this being Sikhs and Muslims.</p>
            <p><a href="https://www.theglobeandmail.com/opinion/columnists/sikhs-have-been-living-in-fear-of-hate-crimes-since-911/article4468643/?arc404=true" target="_blank">An excellent article to comment on this situation is by Ritu Bhasin</a>. In this section she talks about Sikh men, and those with brown skin colour. This article fro 2012 discusses actions that were committed in that year that portray racist roots. Such as the following, It was only a month ago that a Sikh elementary school in the Toronto area was vandalised with the letters “KKK” and swastikas on its walls. Earlier this year, vandals scrawled “terrorist” on Sikh parade posters in Surrey, B.C., while last year a Montreal gurdwara was spray-painted with the words “F--- Indians.”. These actions are clear acts of racism, and they occurred not too long ago. She also goes into detail on how the hate is misguided, and it's those who do not want to delve deeper into Sikhism are at fault, she says “One of the key roots for the violence and hate we experience is that the Sikh faith is so poorly understood.”. This is the fundamental root of most racist action is the misunderstanding of another people. Perhaps with all the media coverage, and news regarding terrible incidents like these, those who are uninformed with this type of racism occurring in current society will band together to help aid those in need, such as the Sikhs.</p>
            <p>Furthermore, if we link about to the government’s involvement in racism, we can see this being true in Bill S-7. The labelling of this bill is where it sparks controversy as it is named, “Zero Tolerance for Barbaric Cultural Practices Act”. It could have been easily called something different as it is a piece of legislation put forward to aid women who are being harmed by their marriages. But the overall approach seems to be zeroing in on the Islamic culture and suggesting that this is a cultural issue, as proposed by the Harper administration. Overall, this act should have been enacted with the primary focus being the aiding women, but alas it was prosed to demonise a culture which in turn is a weak solution.</p>
            <p>In reference to a paper written by <a href="http://digital.library.ryerson.ca/islandora/object/RULA:3018/datastream/OBJ/download/Post_9_11_Anti-Muslim_racism___a_critical_analysis_of_Canada__security_policies___.pdf" target="_blank">Imran Khan from the University of Toronto</a> he ties in the Canadian Muslims as “the new Other” group within North America. It seems as though the anti-Muslim campaign within our society has sky rocketed over the past couple decades due to specific acts of terrorism tied to people of the Muslim faith. He extends to say within his paper that many innocent Muslims now have this false persona associated with them due to the actions of individuals. This allotted to acts of racism by citizens within the country as well, as shown earlier, Anti-Terrorist laws that targeted a particular culture due to radical fundamentalists within it. There has been more research conducted on this, and the feeling of Islamophobia performed by Dr Uzma Jamil. <a href="http://www.ohrc.on.ca/en/creed-freedom-religion-and-human-rights-special-issue-diversity-magazine-volume-93-summer-2012/discrimination-experienced-muslims-ontario" target="_blank">As shown in the article</a> and the study within in it, there is Islamophobia present within Ontario, and it is creating a social divide between specific groups within the province. That is why Dr. Jamil suggests building social cohesion to counter this feeling of Islamophobia within Ontario.</p>

    <!-- How the incidents are linked -->

            <h2 class="text-center">How are these events related if at all?</h2>
            <hr class="small">
            <p>To relate these events, and types of discrimination we need to generalise the core problem. Why are all of these incidents racist or discriminatory, how did they occur? Were they similar in their creation or utterly different in their origins? Well, if we look through the incidents we have listed here they are a few things that we can relate to them. One of these being actions performed by individuals to make other groups feel threatened. For example, the terrorist attacks by radical fundamentalist which then associates their culture or race to that effect. By these actions, it can demonise a set of people due to media attraction and other influences that may bring the ideology of race correlating with that activity. By making this connection and continuously portraying it in the media, to friends, to family, it builds that idea into something that is untrue.</p>
            <p>Another aspect that shows that these are related is the idea of one group of people wanting to be superior to another group of people. It seems to be human nature to compete and strive to be the best, whether it’s sports, academics, or even race. It is hard to understand why this is a mindset that some individuals have but it has been a reoccurring theme throughout history. It seems that there always has to be some separation between humans that depict them to be better than others. Equality is a hard concept fundamentally to act upon due to the human psychology, and the society putting pressure on individuals to perform to the top of their calibre. Nonetheless, this is how foundations of discrimination can be materialised, demeaning those who do not seem to reach the same standards as an individual with more power, such as the government as we have seen, over them.</p>
            <p>Now taking this back a few steps, it’s hard to generalise an ideology and show how it comes to fruition without extensive knowledge and explanation. Here, we are just relating that even though each of these races was discriminated against individually.</p>

            <h2 class="text-center">Has Canada progressed through this prejudice?</h2>
            <hr class="small">
            <p>As short little segment to add to the end of this website before we jump to the map concluding this journey. We have to acknowledge the change that has come over the years and how far Canada has progressed as a country. While going through the chosen topics here through this journey, we also referenced times where there were apologies for actions that were committed. These show the commitment to change and understanding of why the acts performed by individuals in the past were unjust. Learning from mistakes is one of the most fundamental ways to improve the ideology of a person, and therefore of the masses. We had seen a progression in Canada from the Canadian Multiculturalism Act in 1988, to just recently Jagmeet Singh, a Sikh-Canadian becoming the leader of the federal New Democratic Party.</p>
            <p>Also, social cohesion as a collective has been coming more apparent as discrimination occurs from time to time, we see a mass from all cultures, races, aspects of life come together to show that the acts portrayed are by individuals and should not be associated by the group they “belong to”. These are just a few of the actions that show the Canada has been progressing throughout history, but still has a lot to go to ensure that equality is going to a fundamental right for every human being within the country.</p>
